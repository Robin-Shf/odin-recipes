will this even display? anyway...

This project is designed to test the HTML knowledge acquiried so far: boilerplate, links & images, lists, headings, file creation and attributes. And setting up the repository emphasizes the use of git, commit messages and command line basics.

For this project, build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time you’ve finished. Not unless you’re into brutalist web design, that is.

But it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
